dsmeet.com
==========

This was a website I originally developed after my first night playing Mario Kart DS. 
The game lacked social networking features, and I saw an opportunity to build something.

"dsmeet.com" was just wide enough to set as my username, so I registered it and built 
the first version of the site in an evening. I continued to iterate on it for a year and 
subsequently built two other gaming sites (strategywiki.org, abxy.org).
