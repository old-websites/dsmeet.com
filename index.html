    <h1>DSmeet: November 2005 - 2007</h1>
    <p>
      DSmeet was an online social network for Nintendo DS matchmaking that originated 
      in November 2005. It was originally created because the Nintendo DS system lacked 
      the ability to find or make friends when gaming online.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Nintendo DS used "friend codes" for adding contacts for online play. They look 
      and function similarly to phone numbers, except that each person has a unique friend
      code for each game that they play.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DSmeet website featured a friend code sharing system, tournament brackets, 
      pixel art editors, a rudimentary stock market for the game Animal Crossing, friend lists, 
      rich and searchable user profiles, online notifications, private messaging, IRC chat, 
      custom forums, gaming news articles, and much more. It was originally written in vanilla PHP 
      and eventually ported to Zend Framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time DSmeet was popular, we received <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-02-13-ds-meet-introduces-online-tournament-system.html">press
      coverage from Engadget</a> and other major gaming blogs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website later spawned StrategyWiki.org, a wiki focused on video game strategy guides. It was 
      then followed up by a more broadly focused gaming social networking website, Abxy.org, which
      was later briefly featured by Nintendo in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJN7XX26NFU&t=1884s">2007 
      E3 press event</a>.

    <h2> Alpha version </h2>

    <p> 
      The first version of DSmeet was written in vanilla PHP and MySQL and was advertised by 
      setting my Mario Kart display name to "dsmeet.com". I attracted a lot of attention by purposely 
      driving backwards in hundreds of races. Later versions of the Mario Kart game prevent players 
      from driving in reverse while online, and I'd like to think I played a part in that.

    <h2> First major version </h2>

    <p> 
      This version featured a design by Ian Szewczyk, who also designed the original StrategyWiki. 
      It expanded the website to include user-submitted articles and a forum, all of which were custom
      coded (not based on phpBB or similar).

    <h2> Second major version </h2>

    <p>
      The second redesign featured a design by Teddy Bradford, whom we met at the WarpPipe 
      (popular Gamecube online tunneling software) forums.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this time I enlisted the help of two other young engineers and we developed a 
      gaming-focused social network called ABXY based on the lessons we learned from DSmeet. 
      We unfortunately didn't know anything about venture capital or fund raising,
      and we ultimately couldn't afford to devote the time, money, and attention necessary 
      to grow the site while attending college. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We learned an awful lot, and we helped thousands of people connect.
